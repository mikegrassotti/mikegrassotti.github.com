### OK let's setup a blog...

Starting with instructions here: http://jekyllbootstrap.com/ (Zero to Hosted Jekyll Blog in 3 Minutes) 

Maybe later will try some of these tips to customize: http://erjjones.github.io/blog/How-I-built-my-blog-in-one-day/

Figure I will go with this theme: http://themes.jekyllbootstrap.com/preview/mark-reid/  

Github repo: mikegrassotti.github.com

"DO OVER!!"

Oops I just realized jekyll bootstrap is a huge hack. Octopress insteadâ€¦

1. Did this to install: http://octopress.org/docs/setup/
2. Now deploying: http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/

Strange - it didn't add my gh repo as origin and page still not live: http://mikegrassotti.github.io/

DOH! I named repo just mikegrassotti needed to be named mikegrassotti.github.com - tried again, now it works

Chose whiterspace theme - list of options here: https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes
